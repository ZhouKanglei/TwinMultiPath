## Abstract

The twin support vector machine and its extensions have made great achievements in dealing with binary classification problems, however, which is faced with some difficulties such as model selection and solving multi-classification problems quickly. This paper is devoted to the fast regularization parameter tuning algorithm for the twin multi-class support vector machine. A new sample dataset division method is adopted and the Lagrangian multipliers are proved to be piecewise linear with respect to the regularization parameters by combining the linear equations and block matrix theory. Eight kinds of events are defined to seek for the starting event and then the solution path algorithm is designed, which greatly reduces the computational cost. In addition, only few points are combined to complete the initialization and Lagrangian multipliers are proved to be 1 as the regularization parameter tends to infinity. Simulation results based on UCI datasets show that the proposed method can achieve good classification performance with reducing the computational cost of grid search method from exponential level to the constant level.
